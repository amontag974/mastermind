Welcome to mastermind.

In this game, the computer will randomly pick a sequence of four colors 
(abbreviated R, O, Y, G, B, P) and you will attempt to guess it. You will
have 12 turns to do so. When you enter four colors, you will get a four 
character key back that will tell you how accurate your guess was. A "B" 
means one of the colors you guessed was the right color and was in the 
right position. A "W" means that a color was right but its position was 
wrong. A "-" means the color was wrong.

This can be played through the terminal.
